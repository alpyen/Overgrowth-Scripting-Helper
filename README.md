## Installation Guide<a id="installation-guide"></a>
> All steps can be also reproduced on the portable version of Notepad++
1. Download the <a href="https://github.com/alpyen/Overgrowth-Scripting-Helper/releases">latest release</a> which matches your Notepad++ installation (32 bit or 64 bit)
2. Extract the archive and merge the `autoComplete` and the `plugins` folders into the root folder of your Notepad++ installation in Program Files.
3. Start Notepad++ and a rabbit icon should appear in the toolbar.
4. Open the folder for the user defined languages by navigating through the menu <br>`Language > User Defined Language > Open User Defined Language folder...`
5. Copy the `Angelscript UDL.xml` file into the folder and restart Notepad++.
6. That's it, enjoy!

## Troubleshooting & FAQ<a id="troubleshooting-and-faq"></a>
- *Notepad++ shows the error "Cannot load 32-bit plugin." on startup*
  - It seems like you downloaded the wrong version of the plugin.<br>Run Notepad++ and check the version through the menu `? > About Notepad++`.<br>You have to download exactly the same version as the application regardless of your operating system.<br><br>
- *The syntax highlighting is incorrect, it uses ActionScript*
  - This can happen the first time you're launching Notepad++ with the new language definition and had already an \*.as file open. Just switch once to Angelscript by selecting it in the language menu.<br>It shouldn't happen again, if it does you can disable ActionScript in the settings.<br><br>
- *Notepad++ takes ages to start after installing the plugin*
  - This is because the plugin has to load and parse the database file. Since the file is almost 2 MB it might take a second or two on startup.

## Developing<a id="developing"></a>
> Development requires to enable .NET Framework 3.5 from the windows features because one of the N++ Plugin Build DLLs depends on an older version, this is only needed to build the plugin.

The project consists of two solutions: `AsDocs2XML` and `Overgrowth Scripting Helper`.

**AsDocs2XML** is used to parse the header files the game outputs into the XML file format so the plugin can load it.
However the original *_docs.h files are as of right now (Overgrowth 1.4) malformatted and also incorrect which will make them not compliant with the the parser, they'll flat out crash it.

I sanitized and corrected all header files and saved them at `CalltipDefinitions\Overgrowth 1.4`, these files are also references as the command line parameters for the parser.
Sadly VS does not save the command line parameters, so here's an example one: `"../../../CalltipDefinitions/Overgrowth1.4/Camera.txt" `. Just concatenate them all one after the other.

When successfully built and run, AsDocs2XML will output the Notepad++ calltips file `angelscript.xml` and the database file `database.xml` into `AsDocs2XML\bin`.

**Overgrowth Scripting Helper** is the actual plugin and uses post-build commands to move the two files, mentioned above, into their respective folders.
Since these folders are in Program Files, they might be write protected.

If you don't want to run Visual Studio with elevated privileges
you have the option to either use a portable Notepad++ instance, or set the `autoComplete` and the `plugins` folders (and their subfolders) writable as the user you're logged in as.

This is done to streamline the development process, if you are fine with moving the files manually you can simply disable the post-build commands.
> Note that the language definition `Angelscript UDL.xml` is not moved on build since this files does not change.
> It has to be moved once manually.

When successfully built and run, Notepad++ should start with the plugin enabled and ready to test.
> Changes made in the settings will remain because the config file stored in AppData will not be deleted.
